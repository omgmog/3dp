I went back to the drawing board with the amp design, this time with the goal to make the layout more symmetrical and to move the AUX input to the back of the amp.

I desoldered the AUX jack from the AMP board, attached it to some lengths of wire and then glued it in it's new position at the back of the new case.

Since printing and assembling this, I've painted the inside black, and added a layer of black Gorilla tape around the outside to reduce the blue glow of the power LED.

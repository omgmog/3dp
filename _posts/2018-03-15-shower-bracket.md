I'm gradually working my way around the house, looking at little niggling problems and thinking of ways to fix them with 3D printing. Today I addressed an issue in the shower.

In our shower we've got this little basket -- for the shampoo and stuff -- that hangs from the bottom of the shower bracket against the wall. When it contains any weight it tends to lean away from the tiles and get in the way, so I measured, modelled and printed a piece of plastic to hold it in place.

Now to do something about those horrible tiles!

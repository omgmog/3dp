For the first (and definitely not the last) modification to my printer, I've added some LED lights. I've used a cheap strip of USB-powered RGB LEDs, and they're held in place around the top of the frame with their adhesive backing and some zip ties (for extra support!)

Currently they're powered by an external USB plug, but I could probably hook them up to something on the printer or PSU. I might look at that in the future...

I also hooked up a rather dramatic looking _kill switch_ to be able to quickly turn off the printer when something goes wrong. It's sort of bodged together at the moment, I should probably print an enclosure for that...

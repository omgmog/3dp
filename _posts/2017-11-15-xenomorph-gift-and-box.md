It was my friend Dave's birthday, and he loves the Alien movie franchise.

I found a nice model of a [Xenomorph Guard on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1532088) and using Tinkercad stuck it on a base with his name.

I then designed a box to keep the model in, complete with snap-together functioning hinge. The box features the label "NOSTROMO" above the clasp on the front, as a reference to the [ship from the movie](http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/USCSS_Nostromo).

The box had some problem printing -- I suspect due to the layers cooling too fast -- so the edges started to curl up off of the printer bed.

Beyond that it turned out great, and Dave loved it.

I bought a 3D printer!

I've gone with the Anycubic Kossel Plus with linear rails. This is a _Delta_ style printer, in that the head moves on all 3 axis' -- unlike a Cartesian printer where the head moves on the X- and Y-axis, and the printer bed moves up and down the Z-axis. (You can read more about the difference between different types of printer [here](https://all3dp.com/know-your-fdm-3d-printers-cartesian-delta-polar-and-scara/))

I bought the printer as a part-assembled ["kit" from Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MD2IBX4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It took a couple of hours to assemble and set up.

The printer features a heated bed, and it came with a spool of black PLA filament, so I'll be starting with that.

Here are some video reviews:

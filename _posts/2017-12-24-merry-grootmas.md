Another Groot print.. This time for my sister (she is obsessed with Groot, and who doesn't love plastic nick-nacks!?)

These models are by [dav88](https://www.thingiverse.com/dav88/about) on Thingiverse. I printed them at quite a small scale, due to time constraints and demoing the 3D printer to the family.

The standing model was surprisingly problematic, even with a raft and supports. I got it to print fully with a more substantial base added, but even then I had to perform some minor surgery to reattach an arm!

I had more luck with printing the _sitting_ version.
